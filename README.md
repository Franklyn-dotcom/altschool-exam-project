## Introduction

In this project, I will be provisioning two web applications:
- The first aplication will be based on a frontend proxy and a backend database. I will be using nginx frontend proxy and postgres database as my backend database. You can use a different backend database of your choice

I will be using the following tools: 
- Civo cloud provider
